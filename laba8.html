<H2>Do Online Marketing "Tricks" Still Work?</H2>
<P>It’s no secret.</P>
<P>In the last few years making money online has gotten a LOT harder!</P>
<P><STRONG>Google slaps…</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Rising costs of traffic…</STRONG></P>
<P>Markets getting more sophisticated…</P>
<P>In fact, some well known marketers have recently started to say that “online marketing as we know it is DEAD!”</P>
<P>They say that a new breed of marketing has replaced it, and we all need to be Snapchatting and Instagramming all day without ever trying to sell anything…</P>
<P>They claim that we can “guilt people into buying” by just giving… and giving… and giving some more…</P>
<P>And the weird thing is, they’re right.</P>
<P>You can’t just throw up a webpage, buy some adwords traffic and expect to be driving a Lamborghini within a couple months anymore…</P>
<P>(In fact, it never really worked that way…)</P>
<P>But at the same time… you <STRONG>don’t need to overcomplicate</STRONG> it and spend months building out a complex labyrinth that will just confuse your prospects.</P>
<P>No. What you need now is the same thing you’ve always needed…</P>
<P>A solid foundation.</P>
<P>The <STRONG>right offer</STRONG>, <STRONG>presented to the right people</STRONG>, in the<STRONG> right delivery method</STRONG> will give you the ability to create cash “on demand” over and over again.</P>
<P>And how can you find that offer, those people, and the right delivery method?</P>
<P><IMG ALT="funnel" SRC="https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/204573712/funnel.jpg"></P>
<P>Well, there are <STRONG>TWO paths</STRONG>.</P>
<P>First, you can <STRONG>try to do it alone</STRONG>… "follow your passion” and just “do what feels right"... and in about 6 months, chances are pretty good you’ll be right where you started.</P>
<P><STRONG>The second path is smarter.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Find someone else who has done</STRONG> what you want to do, and <STRONG>use their “framework” as your model</STRONG>.</P>
<P>That way you’re building your business on a <STRONG>solid foundation</STRONG>, and you’ll be much more likely to succeed.</P>
<P>Now you probably have lots of questions…</P>
<P><STRONG>"Where do I find someone to model?"</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>"How do I know they’re making lots of money?"</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>"Will this work for my business?"</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>"What about the tech stuff?"</STRONG></P>
<P>And that’s why we want to invite you to this special web class training which will answer all those questions for you.</P>
<P>We’ll show you a behind the scenes look of how to create winning offer, after offer, again and again.</P>
<H2>Who Should Attend:</H2>

This week we will go to: Sightglass Coffee</p> <p>"It’s a badge of honor for shops all over the U.S. to say they’re brewing with Sightglass beans, so why not go to the source? Regulars stake out seats at the SoMa flagship as if it were a high school cafeteria: The short-term visitors hang downstairs, while the lingerers (and people watchers from on high) camp on the second floor near the training lab. The stunningly designed Mission café and roastery is decidedly more chill, though the banquette seating discourages laptop hangouts. And if you’re at the Ferry Building farmers’ market, look for its stand outside on Tuesdays and Saturdays until 2 p.m.</p> <p>PRO TIP: Walk upstairs at the SoMa HQ and check out the Sightglass x Salt and Straw affogato bar, a collab with the Portland ice cream shop. We’ll never say no to floating ice cream in boozy coffee—and you shouldn’t either." - Bon Appetit</p> <p>Let's get to know each other over a cup of delicious coffee!</p> <p>Add to Calendar 07/07/[masked]:00 PM 07/07/[masked]:00 PM America/Los_Angeles Let's get coffee!

<P><SPAN>---</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>When you define your brand, you are essentially creating the soul of your business. Brand is how your customers will connect with you. It creates a way for you to determine what types of marketing to do, the type of team you build, as well as the look and feel of the visual components of your business- such as your logo and website.  With a strong brand you will distinguish yourself from your competitors.  </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>In this workshop, branding expert and co-owner of MeetGeraldine, Lauren Messmer, will guide you through some <STRONG>fun exercises that will help you to build your very own brand profile.</STRONG>  Participants will walk away with an understanding of who their brand is and some helpful hints for how to connect with their target audience.</SPAN></P>
<P>Over the past 15 years, Lauren has been using brand management skills to promote businesses and events. Creating a "brand experience" is one of the most important factors in the success of a business- especially these days. If the marketing materials are not in alignment with the culture and vision of a brand, the consumer gets confused and that leads to them walking away. Instead, a streamlined brand presence will draw consumers in and engage them with the meaning and values of a company.</P>

Embrace cultures past and present in Cusco before travelling by rail to Machu Picchu (hike optional). We will have local guides so that you'll see the best of the region. And, with no hiking, you’ll have lots of time to explore ruins, museums, and markets.</p> <p>I'm excited to get back to Peru again. I've done the classic Inca Trail hike a few years ago with a some friends. The area around Cusco is absolutely stunning! Touring the area, before starting our trek, left me in awe of what the Inca were able to accomplish without modern building material/equipment. We found the locals to be very inviting toward us as tourists. I'm looking forward to exploring some of the cities a bit more that, due to the length of the hike, I was not able to do before. Of course, I'm most excited to try the local cuisine again!</p> <p>Mike Cooper: Group Leader</p> <p><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/9/3/600_457313139.jpeg" /></p> <p>8 days: Lima to Lima</p> <p>What's Included:</p> <p>• Visits to a women's weaving co-op project and a local community pottery demonstration</p> <p>• Sacred Valley guided tour and lunch at the Sacred Valley Community Restaurant in Huchuy Qosco</p> <p>• Train to Machu Picchu (optional hiking add on available if you want to hike it)</p> <p>• Machu Picchu guided tour</p> <p>• Internal flights</p> <p>• All transport between destinations and to/from included activities</p> <p>Itinerary</p> <p>Day 1 Lima</p> <p>Arrive at any time.</p> <p>Please note: if you booked the Culinary Theme Pack it does not include extra time in Lima - booking pre-trip accommodation is highly recommended.

For those who would like to participate in the hike, we suggest booking at least 6-8 months ahead of time to give us the best chance of securing a permit. Permits cannot be blocked and can only be purchased once we have full name, date of birth, nationality and a valid passport number and expiry date from each person who would like to participate. Permits are never guaranteed and are obtained based on availability.</p> <p>*** Having done the classic Inca Trail hike myself, I feel this is a great option for anyone interested. The starting point allows you to bypass the hardest parts of the hike, while still being able to see some of the best, in my opinion, ruins on the hike.</p> <p>Authentic Culinary Package $170</p> <p>Enjoy two half-day cooking activities: one in Cusco and one in Lima. During both, visit local markets, select ingredients, and enjoy unique Peruvian dishes influenced by such faraway places as China, Italy, West Africa, and Japan.</p> <p>**While it is our intention to adhere to the route described in the link, our itineraries are subject to change. In order to improve the traveller experience, on occasion it may be necessary or desirable to make alterations or changes based on customer feedback. We will do the best to notify you of these changes, however we recommend you periodically check the itinerary for the most up-to-date trip details.</p> <p>Only RSVP if you are interested in joining us on this trip. A small fee, at the time of your RSVP, will be applied to your balance. The first 16 people that place their deposits by the due date, will have a guaranteed spot on this trip. (Payment info will be held until we reach our maximum group size or we reach the due date, at which point payments will be processed and the deposit is non-refundable) Once we reach 16 deposits, anyone else interested will be placed on a waiting list until the remaining balance is due. If someone backs out, or chooses not to pay their balance for any reason, those on the wait list will have an opportunity to join and pay the full balance at that time. Again, we will start with a first come basis and work down the list to fill any open spots.

If you are looking to capitalize on the rebound, now is the time! We have sold property in just about every major city in Florida but the one that continuously has the lowest pricing and highest returns is the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL MSA.</p> <p>The median sales price for homes in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL MSA this year was $221,000. This represents an increase of 9.5% compared to the prior year. Hold on to your hats because sales prices have appreciated from a median home price of $135,000 in 2013 to the price of 214,000 at the end of the 2017 year. That's over $79,000 in appreciation within 5 years, with major continued growth on the horizon! Take action now while there is still positive cash flow, which is close to disappearing with rates and prices expected to continue increasing.</p> <p>We have exclusive SFH’s and Duplexes only offered to Marshall Reddick investors:<br/>-Each SFH or duplex is completely rent-ready and turn-key<br/>-Not listed on the MLS in most cases, we work directly with a private seller<br/>-Most are built in 2000 or newer!<br/>-All properties have positive cash flow AND appreciation potential!</p> <p>In 2013, Hertz Corporation relocated its worldwide headquarters to Lee County. This move brought in over 700 jobs within two years. More businesses are realizing what Hertz realized, that low taxes and an abundant amount of sunshine are perfect reasons to move to Lee County.</p> <p>We have a complete turn-key system in place and our property managers are leasing properties extremely fast! Join us online and meet our Regional Florida Reps who will show you a few of the best homes and duplexes available in the entire market. Don’t wait until prices and interest rates continue to rise!</p> <p>In order to receive the Webinar ID and Access Code to join, you must register here: <a href="https://www.marshallreddick.com/event/4bbae088-a6c0-8b25-958e-5b19ff62fe87" class="linkified">https://www.marshallreddick.com/event/4bbae088-a6c0-8b25-958e-5b19ff62fe87</a></p> </div><br><br><h2 class="date"></h2><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/vip-california-farmers-market-tour-private-lunch-dinner-kit-tickets-45697093236?aff=ebapi target=blank>VIP California Farmers' Market Tour, Private Lunch & Dinner Kit</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-07-26T10:30:00</div><br><div class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> <P>Join Founder and Hostess in Chief Christine Martin for lunch as she brings her, fun creative Romantic Dinner Kit to life and shares her secrets for stress-free entertaining as well as tips for preparing healthy, California cuisines at home.</P>
